| **Interests** |  |
| -------: | :---------- |
| *Technology developments* |  I have always been interested in engineering projects and read whenever possible around current developments in fields that interest me. Recently I have been reading up on the Wendelstein 7-X Stellarator and the work by Reaction Engines on their SABRE engines.|
| *Outreach* | Activities At school I was part of the Paper-Clip Physics Team in which we where tasked with presenting an aspect of physics to a panel of scientists and laymen. After doing this I took the same demonstrations to a local preschool and have helped with science demonstrations there on a number of occasions. |
| *Travel* | I have a great curiosity and love of the world and travelling is a part of this. In 2009 I arranged for myself and seven friends to travel overland to Istanbul. This was a substantial but hugely rewarding logistics task. More recently I travelled alone for several months to a variety of places including South Africa and, my favourite destination so far, Indonesia. |
