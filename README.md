| **Computer Skills** |  |
| -------: | :---------- |
| *Python* | This is the main language I have used in the last 12 months. Nearly every experiment run has required new code to be written. I have also been working to create well documented standard libraries for our equipment to save time in future development. |
| *Labview* | I learnt Labview during my previous placement at Siemens and was able to implement an effective solution in under three months. |
| *CAD* | I have been designing a new cryostat in Autodesk Inventor Pro for continuing work on my PhD. In addition I have experience with Google Sketchup and DraftSight. |
| *General* | I am comfortable with Microsoft Windows 98/XP/Vista/7 and using Excel, Word and PowerPoint to present work. In addition I am familiar with document presentation in LATEX. |

| **Practical skills** |  |
| -------: | :---------- |
| Experimental | I have worked cryogenics, vacuum systems, microwave electronics and high current applications. I have also received training for the safe handling of gas cylinders. |

| **Interests** |  |
| -------: | :---------- |
| *Technology developments* |  I have always been interested in engineering projects and read whenever possible around current developments in fields that interest me. Recently I have been reading up on the Wendelstein 7-X Stellarator and the work by Reaction Engines on their SABRE engines.|
| *Outreach Activities* | At school I was part of the Paper-Clip Physics Team in which we where tasked with presenting an aspect of physics to a panel of scientists and laymen. After doing this I took the same demonstrations to a local preschool and have helped with science demonstrations there on a number of occasions. |
| *Travel* | I have a great curiosity and love of the world and travelling is a part of this. In 2009 I arranged for myself and seven friends to travel overland to Istanbul. This was a substantial but hugely rewarding logistics task. More recently I travelled alone for several months to a variety of places including South Africa and, my favourite destination so far, Indonesia. |
