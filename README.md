# Peter Saxton
Currently building rich web applications at my company Workshop 14. Previously started a PhD developing components for quantum computers. Left because the real world has a much faster feedback loop. Enjoys working with Ruby, Elixir and JavaScript. p.s. also erlang, Typescript, Python, Haskell, Ocaml, Kotlin, labview, D and scala. Will take any opportunity to get immersed in the Great Outdoors.

Experience
----------

##### Projects *2013-current*
> I have run two successful Kickstarter campaigns for my project to redesign the [London Tube map](http://www.londonlayout.co.uk). During this time I have learnt about SVG graphics and Javascript

##### Maths and Science Tutor, London *2013-current*
> I have tutored Math, Physics and Chemistry to students from GCSE to Degree level. 

##### Software Developer, Siemens Magnet Technology, Eynsham, Oxon *2011–2011*
> I was placed with the magnet team for the development of a high speed data logger. This system was to monitor up to 40 channels at microsecond resolution. My role was to devise and program algorithms to filter for events on the magnet, saving these and automatically discarding the rest of the raw data. Through this project I became competent with LabVIEW.

##### Temporary work, Manpower, Exeter, Devon *2010*
> I was employed in a number of roles including cleaning at a quarry, assisting a professional photographer and working nights in a Royal Mail sorting office.

##### Summer Placement, Siemens Magnet Technology, Enysham, Oxon *2008*
> I was given an independent project to design, build and test an experimental persistent current switch with the aim of investigating current distributions in multi-strand wire. This project taught me a variety of practical skills as well as useful experience working with several people across a large organisation.

| **Computer Skills** |  |
| -------: | :---------- |
| *Ruby*  | As the focus of the Makers Academy course I am capable at developing Ruby applications. I have experience with the Sinatra and Rails Framework and testing with Rspec, Capybara and Cucumber. |
| *Git* | I use git in all projects as part of an efficient work-flow and am familiar with branching, forking a repo and submitting a pull request. |
| *JavaScript* | Self taught through working on my own projects I can write high quality code that is test driven using Karma, Jasmine and Grunt. I have worked JQuery, Node and Hammer and many more smaller libraries. |
| *Python* | This is the main language I used in my year at Heriot Watt. Nearly every experiment run has required new code to be written. I have also been working to create well documented standard libraries for our equipment to save time in future development. |
| *LabVIEW* | I learnt LabVIEW during placement at Siemens and was able to implement a high frequency data logger in under three months. |
| *CAD* | I have been designing a new cryostat in Autodesk Inventor Pro for continuing work on my PhD. In addition I have experience with Google Sketchup and DraftSight. |
| *LaTeX* | I am familiar with document presentation in LaTeX. |

| **Practical skills** |  |
| -------: | :---------- |
| *Experimental* | I have worked cryogenics, vacuum systems, microwave electronics and high current applications. I have also received training for the safe handling of gas cylinders. |

| **Interests** |  |
| -------: | :---------- |
| *Technology developments* |  I have always been interested in engineering projects and read whenever possible around current developments in fields that interest me. Recently I have been reading up on the Wendelstein 7-X Stellarator and the work by Reaction Engines on their SABRE engines.|
| *Outreach Activities* | At school I was part of the Paper-Clip Physics Team in which we where tasked with presenting an aspect of physics to a panel of scientists and laymen. After doing this I took the same demonstrations to a local preschool and have helped with science demonstrations there on a number of occasions. |
| *Travel* | I have a great curiosity and love of the world and travelling is a part of this. In 2009 I arranged for myself and seven friends to travel overland to Istanbul. This was a substantial but hugely rewarding logistics task. More recently I travelled alone for several months to a variety of places including South Africa and, my favourite destination so far, Indonesia. |
