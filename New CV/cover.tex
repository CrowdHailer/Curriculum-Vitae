\opening{Dear Sir or Madam}
I noticed your advert for the position of scientific software engineer and would like to express my strong interest in the position. I am currently a PhD student and recently completed my first year. I have decided it is right for me to leave at my current stage. The career direction I am seeking is one that allows me to continue to use the science which is a passion of mine while become more focussed on applied problems and engineering solutions.

Throughout my physics career to date I have developed a systematic as well as inquisitive approach to solving problems. I regard this skill as one of my main strengths and one which would contribute well to my success in the position with your company. I have experience with two of Tessella's core programming languages and am always looking to broaden and develop my knowledge.

I appreciate the time spent on considering this application. I look forward to hearing from you in due course.
